## What is this for?
I am working on this project for my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) - which involves writing a short dissertation and optionally producing an artefact. As I've for many years had an interest in machine learning, I decided to attempt to produce a neural network that will play Classic Tetris as the artefact component of the EPQ.

If people want to read the dissertation, I will release it publicly after it has been graded!

## Getting Started
If you just want to have a look at the program, it is available at [my website](https://piturnah.xyz/tetris-epq/). However, it should be noted that this build is not the best representation of the project.

Alternatively, you can install the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) and clone the repo to wherever you'd like (for example, your directory for Unity projects). From there, you should be able to open and run the project with ease.

```
git clone https://github.com/Piturnah/tetris-ann-epq.git
```

## Built with

- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/)
