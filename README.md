# NEAT Machine learning - AI plays Tetris!

## This project is still in early development!!

## What is this for?
I am working on this project for my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) - which involves writing a short dissertation and optionally producing an artefact. As I've for many years had an interest in machine learning, I decided to attempt to produce a neural network that will play Classic Tetris as the artefact component of the EPQ.

If people want to read the dissertation, I will release it publically after it has been graded!

## Getting Started
If you'd like to run this yourself, currently the only way is to install the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) and clone the repo to wherever you'd like (for example, your directory for Unity projects). From there, you should be able to open and run the project with ease.

Example: (yes, I just wanted an excuse to quote code)

```
git clone https://github.com/Piturnah/tetris-ann-epq.git
```

In the future, builds will be released for Windows.
