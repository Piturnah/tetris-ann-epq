## What is this for?
This project was done for the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) - which involves writing a short dissertation and optionally producing an artefact. As I've for many years had an interest in machine learning, I decided to attempt to produce a neural network that will play Classic Tetris as the artefact component of the EPQ.

The dissertation can be read on [my website](https://piturnah.xyz/tetris-epq/paper.pdf) or in the project [source](./paper.pdf)

## Getting Started
If you just want to have a look at the program, it is available at [my website](https://piturnah.xyz/tetris-epq/). However, it should be noted that this build is not the best representation of the project.

Alternatively, you can install the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) and clone the repo to wherever you'd like (for example, your directory for Unity projects). From there, you should be able to open and run the project with ease.

```
git clone https://github.com/Piturnah/tetris-ann-epq.git
```

## References
The [NEAT](./Projects/Tetris_Training/Assets/Scripts/NEAT) portion of the code was built with a lot of reference to [NEAT Paper](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/ftp/AI-Lab/tech-reports/UT-AI-TR-01-290.pdf) and Finn Egger's [Java implementation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgomWLYGNl1fcL0o4exBShNeCC5tc6s9C).
